# Exploring trends in the data set of Hacker News site

The main task was to investigate which posts (ask or show) receive more comments on average and to determine if posts created at a specific time receive more comments.

It was found that the best time to post Ask HN posts (15:00), in order to increase the amount of received comments. The number of upvotes can sugest that Ask and Show posts can exhibit different user profiles, an interesting question that could be addressed further. Finally, the trends in upvotes and comments received by Ask HN posts are very similar and sugest that not all commenters of these post vote.
